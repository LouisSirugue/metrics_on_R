### 1. Setup

The packages needed in an Rmd must *always* be loaded in a code chunk at the beginning of the file.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

However, the command `install.packages()` must **not** be written in an R markdown.  
It should be run only once in the console.

### 2. Computations

The `rnorm(n, mean, sd)` command allows to generate n observations drawn from a normal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)
```

We can compute the mean $\overline{x}$ of this variable:

$$\overline{x}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$$

```{r}
mean(x)
```

Here is the result, written in **inline code** such that it updates automatically: `r mean(x)`
