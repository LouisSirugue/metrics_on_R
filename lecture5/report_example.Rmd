## Overview of the data

```{r cars}
# Omit if distance >= 100
cars <- cars[cars$dist < 100, ]
names(cars)
dim(cars)
c(mean(cars$speed), mean(cars$dist))
```

The dataset we consider contains two variables, speed and distance, and has `r dim(cars)[1]` observations. The average speed value is `r mean(cars$speed)` and the average distance value is `r mean(cars$dist)`.
